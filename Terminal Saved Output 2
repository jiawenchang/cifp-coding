   The University of St Andrews (informally known as St Andrews University
   or simply St Andrews; abbreviated as St And, from the Latin Sancti
   Andreae, in post-nominals) is a British public research university in
   St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. It is the oldest of the four ancient
   universities of Scotland and the third oldest university in the
   English-speaking world (following Oxford and Cambridge Universities).
   St Andrews was founded between 1410 and 1413, when the Avignon Antipope
   Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of
   Augustinian clergy.

   St Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions, comprising three
   colleges â€“ United College (a union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's
   Colleges), St Mary's College, and St Leonard's College, the last named
   being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard's as a post-graduate
   society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four
   faculties.^[5] The university occupies historic and modern buildings
   located throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two
   terms, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the
   town's population is either a staff member or student of the
   university.^[6] The student body is notably diverse: over 135
   nationalities are represented with 45% of its intake from countries
   outside the UK; about one-eighth of the students are from the rest of
   the EU and the remaining third are from overseas â€” 15% from North
   America alone.^[7]^[8] The university's sport teams compete in BUCS
   competitions,^[9] and the student body is known for preserving ancient
   traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May Dip, and the wearing of
   distinctive academic dress.^[10]

   It is consistently ranked as the third best university in the United
   Kingdom in all national league tables, behind Oxbridge.^[11]^[12]^[13]
   The Guardian ranks first in the United Kingdom the Schools of Physics
   and Astronomy, International Relations, Computer Science, Geography,
   English and Mathematics,^[12] whilst The Times and Sunday Times ranks
   the Schools of English, Management, Philosophy, Anatomy and Physiology
   and Middle Eastern and African Studies first^[14] and the Complete
   University Guide ranks Management, Divinity and Middle Eastern and
   African Studies first.^[15] The Times Higher Education World
   Universities Ranking names St Andrews among the world's Top 50
   universities for Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities.^[16]^[17] St
   Andrews has the highest student satisfaction (joint first) amongst all
   multi-faculty universities in the United Kingdom.^[18]

   St Andrews has many notable alumni and affiliated faculty, including
   eminent mathematicians, scientists, theologians, philosophers, and
   politicians. Recent alumni include the former First Minister of
   Scotland Alex Salmond; former Secretary of State for Defence Michael
   Fallon; HM British Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward; United States
   Ambassador to Hungary Colleen Bell; Olympic cycling gold medalist Chris
   Hoy; and royals Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine,
   Duchess of Cambridge. Six Nobel Laureates are among St Andrews' alumni
   and former staff: two in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine, and one
   each in Peace and Literature.

History[edit]

   Main article: History of the University of St Andrews

Foundation[edit]

   St Salvator's Chapel
   College Hall, within the 16th century St Mary's College building

   The university was founded in 1410 when a group of Augustinian clergy,
   driven from the University of Paris by the Avignon schism and from the
   universities of Oxford and Cambridge by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, formed
   a society of higher learning in St Andrews, which offered courses of
   lectures in divinity, logic, philosophy, and law. A charter of
   privilege was bestowed upon the society of masters and scholars by the
   Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw, on 28 February 1411.^[19] Wardlaw
   then successfully petitioned the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII to grant
   the school university status by issuing a series of papal bulls, which
   followed on 28 August 1413.^[20] King James I of Scotland confirmed the
   charter of the university in 1432. Subsequent kings supported the
   university with King James V "confirming privileges of the university"
   in 1532.^[21]^[22]

   A college of theology and arts called St John's College was founded in
   1418^[23] by Robert of Montrose and Lawrence of Lindores. St Salvator's
   College was established in 1450, by Bishop James Kennedy.^[24] St
   Leonard's College was founded in 1511 by Archbishop Alexander Stewart,
   who intended it to have a far more monastic character than either of
   the other colleges. St John's College was refounded by Cardinal James
   Beaton under the name St Mary's College in 1538 for the study of
   divinity and law. It was intended to encourage traditional Catholic
   teachings in opposition to the emerging Scottish Reformation, but once
   Scotland had formally split with the Papacy in 1560, it became a
   teaching institution for Protestant clergy.^[25] Some university
   buildings that date from this period are still in use today, such as St
   Salvator's Chapel, St Leonard's College Chapel and St Mary's College
   quadrangle. At this time, the majority of the teaching was of a
   religious nature and was conducted by clerics associated with the
   cathedral.

Development[edit]

   During the 17th and 18th centuries, the university had mixed fortunes
   and was often beset by civil and religious disturbances. In a
   particularly acute depression in 1747, severe financial problems
   triggered the dissolution of St Leonard's College, whose properties and
   staff were merged into St Salvator's College to form the United College
   of St Salvator and St Leonard.^[19] Throughout this period student
   numbers were very low; for instance, when Samuel Johnson visited the
   university in 1773, the university had fewer than 100 pupils, and was
   in his opinion in a steady decline. He described it as "pining in decay
   and struggling for life".^[26] The poverty of Scotland during this
   period also damaged St Andrews, as few were able to patronise the
   university and its colleges, and with state support being improbable,
   the income they received was scarce.

Modern period[edit]

   St Salvator's Chapel in 1843

   In the second half of the 19th century, pressure was building upon
   universities to open up higher education to women.^[27] In 1876, the
   University Senate decided to allow women to receive an education at St
   Andrews at a level roughly equal to the Master of Arts degree that men
   were able to take at the time. The scheme came to be known as the
   'L.L.A. examination' (Lady Literate in Arts). It required women to pass
   five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level and
   entitled them to hold a degree from the university.^[28] In 1889 the
   Universities (Scotland) Act^[29] made it possible to formally admit
   women to St Andrews and to receive an education equal to that of male
   students. Agnes Forbes Blackadder became the first woman to graduate
   from St Andrews on the same level as men in October 1894, gaining her
   MA. She entered the university in 1892, making St Andrews the first
   university in Scotland to admit female undergraduates on the same level
   as men.^[30] In response to the increasing number of female students
   attending the university, the first women's hall was built in 1896 and
   was named University Hall.^[31]

   Up until the start of the 20th century, St Andrews offered a
   traditional education based on classical languages, divinity and
   philosophical studies, and was slow to embrace more practical fields
   such as science and medicine that were becoming more popular at other
   universities. In response to the need for modernisation and in order to
   increase student numbers and alleviate financial problems, the
   university merged with University College, Dundee in 1897, which had a
   focus on scientific and professional subjects. After the incorporation
   of University College Dundee, St Andrews' various problems generally
   receded. Of note is that, up until 1967, many students who obtained a
   degree from the University of St Andrews had in fact spent most, and
   sometimes all, of their undergraduate career based in Dundee.
   The "Gateway" building, built in 2000 and now used for the university's
   management department

   As the 20th century progressed, it became increasingly popular among
   the Scottish upper classes to send their children to the country's
   oldest higher learning institution,^[citation needed] and the
   university's student population rose sharply.^[tone] This revival has
   been maintained to the present day.^[tone] Despite this, there have
   been some notable changes.^[citation needed] In 1967, the union with
   University College Dundee ended, when that College became an
   independent institution under the name of the University of Dundee. As
   a result of this, St Andrews lost its capacity to provide degrees in
   many areas such as Law, Accountancy, Dentistry and Engineering, while
   it also lost the right to confer the undergraduate medical degree
   MBChB. However, the university has prospered in other ways.^[citation
   needed]^[tone] In 1972, the College of St Leonard was reconstituted as
   a postgraduate institute.^[32]

Links with the United States[edit]

   St Andrews' historical links with the United States predate the
   country's independence. One of the signatories of the Declaration of
   Independence attended (but did not graduate from) St Andrews. James
   Wilson was one of six original justices appointed by George Washington
   to the Supreme Court of the United States and founder of the University
   of Pennsylvania Law School. Other prominent American figures associated
   with St Andrews include Scottish American industrialist Andrew
   Carnegie, who was elected Rector in 1901 and whose name is given to the
   prestigious Carnegie Scholarship, and Edward Harkness, an American
   philanthropist who in 1930 provided for the construction of St
   Salvator's Hall. American Bobby Jones, co-founder of the Augusta
   National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament, was named a Freeman of
   the City of St Andrews in 1958, becoming only the second American to be
   so honored, the other being Benjamin Franklin in 1759.^[33] Today a
   highly competitive scholarship exchange, The Robert T. Jones
   Scholarship, exists between St Andrews and Emory University in Atlanta.

   Links with the United States have been maintained into the present day
   and continue to grow. In 2009, Louise Richardson, an Irish-American
   political scientist specialized in the study of terrorism, was drawn
   from Harvard to serve as the first female Principal and Vice Chancellor
   of St Andrews.^[34] She later went on to her next appointment as the
   Vice Chancellor to the University of Oxford.^[35]

   Active recruitment of students from North America first began in 1984,
   with Americans now making up around 1 in 6 of the student population in
   2017.^[36] Students from almost every state in the United States and
   province in Canada are represented.^[7]^[37] This is the highest
   proportion and absolute number of American students amongst all British
   universities.^[38]^[39] Media reports indicate growing numbers of
   American students are attracted to the university's academics,
   traditions, prestige, internationalism, and comparatively low tuition
   fees.^[40]^[41]^[42]^[43] The university also regularly features as one
   of the few non-North American universities in the Fiske Guide to
   Colleges, an American college guide, as a 'Best Buy'.^[44]^[45] St
   Andrews has developed a sizable alumni presence in the United States,
   with over 8000 alumni spread across all 50 states.^[46] Most major
   cities host alumni clubs, the largest of which is in New York.^[47]
   Both London and New York also host the St Andrews Angels, an alumni led
   angel investment network, which centres upon the wider university
   communities in both the United Kingdom and United States.^[48] St
   Andrews has also established relationships with other university alumni
   clubs and private membership clubs in the United States to provide
   alumni with social and networking opportunities. For example, alumni
   are eligible for membership at the Princeton Club of New York and the
   Algonquin Club in Boston.^[49]^[50]

   In 2013, Hillary Clinton, former United States Secretary of State, took
   part in the academic celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the
   founding of the University of St Andrews.^[51] Clinton received an
   honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and provided the graduation address,
   in which she said, "I do take comfort from knowing there is a long
   tradition of Americans being warmly welcomed here at St Andrews. Every
   year I learn you educate more than one thousand American students,
   exposing them to new ideas and perspectives as well as according them
   with a first class education. Iâ€™ve been proud and fortunate to hire a
   few St Andrews alumni over the years and I thank you for training them
   so well."^[52]

Governance and administration[edit]

   Courtyard of the United College
   Main article: Governance of the University of St Andrews

   As with the other ancient universities of Scotland, the governance of
   the university is determined by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.
   This Act created three bodies: the General Council, University Court
   and Academic Senate (Senatus Academicus).

General Council[edit]

   Main article: General Council of St Andrews University

   The General Council is a standing advisory body of all the graduates,
   academics and former academics of the university. It meets twice a year
   and appoints a business committee to manage business between these
   meetings. Its most important functions are to appoint two assessors to
   the University Court and elect the university's chancellor.

University Court[edit]

   School of English

   The University Court is the body responsible for administrative and
   financial matters, and is in effect the governing body of the
   university. It is chaired by the rector, who is elected by the
   matriculated students of the University. Members are appointed by the
   General Council, Academic Senate and Fife Council. The President of the
   Students' Association and Director of Representation are ex officio
   members of the Court. Several lay members are also co-opted and must
   include a fixed number of alumni of the University.

Senatus Academicus[edit]

   The Academic Senate (Latin Senatus Academicus) is the supreme academic
   body for the university. Its members include all the professors of the
   university, certain senior readers, a number of senior lecturers and
   lecturers and three elected student senate representatives â€“ one from
   the arts and divinity faculty, one from the science and medicine
   faculty and one postgraduate student. It is responsible for authorising
   degree programmes and issuing all degrees to graduates, and for
   managing student discipline. The President of the Senate is the
   University Principal.

Office of the Principal[edit]

   The Principal is the chief executive of the university and is assisted
   in that role by several key officers, including the Deputy Principal,
   Master of the United College and Quaestor. The principal has
   responsibility for the overall running of the university and presides
   over the University Senate.^[53]

Rector[edit]

   Main article: Rector of the University of St Andrews

   In Scotland, the position of rector exists at the four ancient
   universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) â€“ as well as
   the University of Dundee. The post was made an integral part of these
   universities by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. The Rector of the
   University of St Andrews chairs meetings of the University Court, the
   governing body of the university; and is elected by the matriculated
   student body to ensure that their needs are adequately considered by
   the university's leadership. Through St Andrews' history a number of
   notable people have been elected to the post, including the actor John
   Cleese, industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, author and
   poet Rudyard Kipling and the British Prime Minister Archibald Primrose,
   5th Earl of Rosebery.^[54]

Colleges[edit]

   The university encompasses three colleges, although their purpose is
   mainly ceremonial as students are housed in separate residential halls
   or private accommodations. United College has responsibility for all
   students in the faculties of arts, sciences and medicine, and is based
   around St Salvator's Quadrangle;^[55] St Mary's College has
   responsibility for all students studying in the Faculty of Divinity,
   and has its own dedicated site in St Mary's Quadrangle;^[56] and St
   Leonard's College, in its current incarnation, has responsibility for
   all postgraduate students.^[57]

Faculties and schools[edit]

   The four academic faculties collectively encompass 18 schools. A dean
   is appointed by the Master of the United College to oversee the
   day-to-day running of each faculty. Students apply to become members of
   a particular faculty, as opposed to the school within which teaching is
   based. The faculties and their affiliated schools are:
     * Faculty of Arts: art history, classics, economics, English, film
       studies, history, international relations, management, modern
       languages, philosophy.^[58]
     * Faculty of Divinity: divinity.^[59]
     * Faculty of Medicine: medicine.^[60]
     * Faculty of Science: biology, chemistry, computer science, geography
       and geosciences, mathematics, physics and astronomy, psychology and
       neuroscience.^[61]

   Certain subjects are offered both within the Faculties of Arts and
   Sciences, the six subjects are: economics, geography, management,
   mathematics, psychology and sustainable development. The content of the
   subject is the same regardless of the faculty.^[62]

Academics[edit]

Semesters[edit]

   The Scores

   The academic year at St Andrews is divided into two semesters,
   Martinmas and Candlemas, named after two of the four Scottish Term and
   Quarter Days. Martinmas, on 11 November, was originally the feast of
   Saint Martin of Tours, a 4th-century bishop and hermit. Candlemas
   originally fell on 2 February, the day of the feast of the
   Purification, or the Presentation of Christ. Martinmas semester runs
   from early September until mid-December, with examinations taking place
   just before the Christmas break. There follows an inter-semester period
   when Martinmas semester business is concluded and preparations are made
   for the new Candlemas semester, which starts in January and concludes
   with examinations at the end of May. Graduation is celebrated at the
   end of June.^[63]

   In a ranking conducted by The Guardian, St Andrews is placed 5th in the
   UK for national reputation behind Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial &amp;
   LSE.^[72] When size is taken into account, St Andrews ranks second in
   the world out of all small to medium-sized fully comprehensive
   universities (after Brown University) using metrics from the QS
   Intelligence Unit in 2015.^[73] The 2014 Research Excellence Framework
   ranked St Andrews 14th in the UK, and first in Scotland, amongst
   multi-faculty institutions for the research quality (GPA) of its output
   profile.^[74] St Andrews was ranked 9th overall in The Sunday Times
   10-year (1998â€“2007) average ranking of British universities based on
   consistent league table performance,^[75] and is a member of the
   'Sutton 13' of top ranked Universities in the UK.^[76]

   Nearly 86% of its graduates obtain a First Class or an Upper Second
   Class Honours degree.^[77] The ancient Scottish universities award
   Master of Arts degrees (except for science students who are awarded a
   Bachelor of Science degree) which are classified upon graduation, in
   contrast to Oxbridge where one becomes a Master of Arts after a certain
   number of years, and the rest of the UK, where graduates are awarded
   BAs. These can be awarded with honours; the majority of students
   graduate with honours.

   In 2017, St Andrews was named as the university with the joint second
   highest graduate employment rate of any UK university (along with
   Warwick), with 97.7 per cent of its graduates in work or further study
   three and a half years after graduation.^[78] St Andrews is placed 7th
   in the UK (1st in Scotland) for the employability of its graduates as
   chosen by recruiters from the UK's major companies^[79] with graduates
   expected to have the best graduate prospects and highest starting
   salaries in Scotland as ranked by The Times and Sunday Times Good
   University Guide 2016 and 2017.^[80] An independent report conducted by
   Swedish investment firm, Skandia found that St Andrews is, despite its
   small undergraduate body, the joint-5th best university in the UK for
   producing millionaires.^[81] A study by High Fliers confirmed this by
   reporting that the university also features in the top 5 of UK
   universities for producing self-made millionaires.^[82] According to a
   study by the Institute of Employment Research, St Andrews has produced
   more directors of FTSE 100 companies in proportion to its size than any
   other educational institution in Britain.^[83]

   The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2017 revealed that 24
   of the 26 subjects offered by St Andrews ranked within the top 6
   nationally with 10 subjects placing within the top 3 including English,
   Management, Philosophy, International Relations, Italian, Physics and
   Astronomy and Classics and Ancient History.^[84] In the 2018 Complete
   University Guide, 23 out of the 25 subjects offered by St Andrews rank
   within the top 10 nationally making St Andrews one of only four
   multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge, Oxford and Durham) in
   the UK to have over 90% of their subjects in the top 10.^[85] The
   Guardian University Guide 2016 ranked Computer Science, Geography,
   International Relations and Divinity first in the UK. Chemistry,
   History, Philosophy, History of Art, Physics, English and Earth and
   Marine Science were ranked within the top three whilst Management,
   Classics and Mathematics placed within the top five.^[86] In the
   2015-16 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, St Andrews is
   ranked 46th in the world for Social Sciences,^[16] 50th in the world
   for Arts and Humanities^[17] and 74th in the world for Life
   Sciences.^[87] The 2014 CWTS Leiden rankings, which "aims to provide
   highly accurate measurements of the scientific impact of universities",
   placed St Andrews 39th in the world, ranking it 5th domestically.^[88]
   The philosophy department is ranked 14th worldwide (4th in Europe) in
   the 2015 QS World University Rankings^[89] whilst the graduate
   programme was ranked 17th worldwide (2nd in the UK) by the 2009
   Philosophical Gourmet's biennial report on Philosophy programs in the
   English-speaking world.^[90]

   The university receives applications mainly through UCAS and the Common
   Application with the latest figures showing that there are generally 12
   applications per undergraduate place available.^[92] Overall, the
   university is one of the most competitive universities in the UK, with
   2016-17 having an acceptance rate of 8.35% and offer rate of 22.5% for
   Scottish/EU applicants where places are capped by the Scottish
   Government.^[93]^[94] In 2017, the most competitive courses for
   Scottish/EU applicants were those within the Schools of International
   Relations, Management, and Economics and Finance with offer rates of
   8.0%, 10.9% and 11.5% respectively.^[93]^[95] The standard offer of a
   place tends to require five best Highers equivalent to AAAAB, three
   best A-levels equivalent to AAA or a score of at least 38 points on the
   International Baccalaureate.^[96] Successful entrants have, on average,
   525 UCAS points (the equivalent of just above A*A*AA at A Level)
   ranking it as the 5th highest amongst higher education institutions in
   the UK for the 2015 admissions cycle^[97] with The Telegraph naming it
   as the hardest university to gain admission into in Scotland.^[98]

   The university has one of the smallest percentages of students (13%)
   from lower income backgrounds, out of all higher education institutions
   in the UK.^[99]^[100] Around 40% of the student body is from
   independent schools^[101] and the university hosts the highest
   proportion of financially independent students (58%) in the UK.^[102]
   The university participates in widening access schemes such as the
   Sutton Trust Summer School, First Chances Programme, REACH &amp; SWAP
   Scotland, and Access for Rural Communities (ARC) in order to promote a
   more widespread uptake of those traditionally under represented at
   university.^[103] In the seven-year period between 2008 and 2015, the
   number of pupils engaged with annual outreach programmes at the
   university has increased by about tenfold whilst the number of students
   arriving at St Andrews from the most deprived backgrounds has increased
   by almost 50 per cent in the past year of 2015.^[104] The university
   has a slightly higher proportion of female than male students with a
   male to female ratio of 44:56 in the undergraduate population.^[105]

Lecture series[edit]

   The University of St Andrews Classics Building, Swallowgate

   To commemorate the university's 600th anniversary the 600th Lecture
   Series was commissioned in 2011, which brought diverse speakers such as
   former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, naturalist David Attenborough and
   linguist Noam Chomsky to St Andrews.^[106]

   As part of the celebration of the 400th establishment of the King James
   Library, the King James Library lectures were initiated in 2009 on the
   subject of 'The Meaning of the Library'.^[107]

   The Andrew Lang Lecture series was initiated in 1927, and named for
   alumnus and poet Andrew Lang. The most famous lecture in this series is
   that given by J. R. R. Tolkien in March 1939, entitled 'Fairy Stories',
   but published subsequently as 'On Fairy-Stories'.^[108]

   The computing Distinguished Lecture Series was initiated in 1969 by
   Jack Cole.^[109]

Exchange programmes[edit]

   Tower of St Salvator's Chapel

   St Andrews has developed student exchange partnerships with
   universities around the globe, though offerings are largely
   concentrated in North America, Europe, and Asia. Exchange opportunities
   vary by School and eligibility requirements are specific to each
   exchange program.^[110]

   In North America, the highly competitive Bachelor of Arts International
   Honours program, run in conjunction with The College of William and
   Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, allows students studying Classical
   Studies, Film Studies, International Relations, English, History, or
   Economics to spend two years at each institution and earn a joint
   degree from both.^[111] The Robert T. Jones Memorial Trust funds the
   Robert T. Jones Jr. Scholarship, which allows select St Andrews
   students to study, fully funded, for a year at Emory University in
   Atlanta, and Western University and Queen's University in Canada.^[112]
   The Robert Lincoln McNeil Scholarship allows students to study at the
   University of Pennsylvania. One of the largest North American exchanges
   is with the University of California System, in which students can
   study at Berkeley, Los Angeles (UCLA), Santa Cruz (UCSC) and San Diego
   (UCSD). Other North American partners offering multiple exchanges
   include the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at
   Chapel Hill, Washington and Lee University, Elon University, and the
   University of Toronto.^[110] Some exchanges are offered within specific
   research institutes at St Andrews, rather than across entire Schools.
   For example, the Handa Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political
   Violence, within the School of International Relations, offers student
   exchanges in partnership with the School of Foreign Service at
   Georgetown University.^[113]

   St Andrews participates in the Erasmus Programme and has direct
   exchanges with universities across Europe.^[110] For example, in France
   exchanges are offered at the Sorbonne, Sciences Po, and University of
   Paris VI. In the Netherlands students can study at Leiden University
   and Utrecht University. Narrower exchanges include those with the
   University of Copenhagen, the University of Oslo, and Trinity College
   Dublin. Exchanges are also available for postgraduate research
   students, such as the opportunity for social scientists to study at the
   European University Institute in Florence, Italy.

   More recently, St Andrews has developed exchanges with partners in Asia
   and Australia.^[110] Notable partners include the University of Hong
   Kong and Renmin University of China, National University of Singapore,
   and the University of Melbourne in Australia.

Buildings, collections and facilities[edit]

   Observatory of the university

   The University of St Andrews is situated in the small town of St
   Andrews in rural Fife, Scotland. The University has teaching
   facilities, libraries, student housing and other buildings spread
   throughout the town. Generally, university departments and buildings
   are concentrated on North Street, South Street, The Scores, and the
   North Haugh. The university has two major sites within the town. The
   first is the United College, St Andrews (also known as the Quad or St
   Salvator's) on North Street, which functions both as a teaching space
   and venue for student events, incorporating the Departments of Social
   Anthropology and Modern Languages. The second is St Mary's College, St
   Andrews, based on South Street, which houses the Schools of Divinity,
   Psychology and Neuroscience, as well as the King James Library. Several
   schools are located on The Scores including Classics, English, History,
   Philosophy, the School of Economics and Finance, and International
   Relations, as well as the Admissions department, the Museum of the
   University of St Andrews, and the Principal's residence, University
   House. North Street is also the site of several departments including,
   the Principal's Office, The Younger Hall, Department of Film Studies,
   and the University Library. The North Haugh is principally home to the
   Natural Sciences such as Chemistry, Physics, Biology, as well as
   Mathematics, Computer Science, Medicine and the School of Management.

Libraries and museums[edit]

   St Andrews University library building

   The University of St Andrews maintains one of the most extensive
   university library collections in the United Kingdom, which includes
   significant holdings of books, manuscripts, muniments and photographs.
   The library collection contains over a million volumes and over two
   hundred thousand rare and antique books.^[114]

   The university library was founded by King James VI in 1612, with the
   donation of 350 works from the royal collection, at the urging of
   George Gledstanes, the then chancellor of St Andrews, although the
   libraries of the colleges of St Leonard's College, St Salvator's
   College and St Mary's College had existed prior to this.^[115]^[116]
   From 1710 to 1837 the library functioned as a legal deposit library,
   and as a result has an extensive collection of 18th century
   literature.^[117]
   King James Library

   The library's main building is located on North Street, and houses over
   1,000,000 books.^[118] The library was designed by the leading firm of
   architects Faulkner-Brown Hendy Watkinson Stonor led by Harry
   Faulkner-Brown and based in the North East England at
   Killingworth.^[119] Faulkner-Brown specialised in libraries and leisure
   facilities and also designed the National Library of Canada in Ottawa
   and the Robinson Library at Newcastle University ^[120]^[121] In 2011
   the main library building underwent a Â£7 million re-development.^[122]
   The historic King James library, built in 1643, houses the university's
   Divinity and Medieval history collections.^[123]

   In 2012 the University purchased the vacant Martyrs' Church on North
   Street, with the purpose of providing reading rooms for the Special
   Collections department and University research students and
   staff.^[124]
   University of St Andrews library from above with West Sands in the
   background

   The University maintains several museums and galleries, open for free
   to the public.^[125] The Museum of the University of St Andrews (MUSA)
   opened in 2008 and displays some highlights of the university's
   extensive collection of over 100,000 artefacts.^[126] It displays
   objects relating both to the history of the university, such as its
   collection of 15th century maces,^[127] and also unrelated objects,
   such as paintings by John Opie, Alberto Morrocco and Charles
   Sims.^[128] Several of the university's collections have been
   recognised as being of 'national significance for Scotland' by Museums
   Galleries Scotland.^[129]

   The Bell Pettigrew Museum houses the University's natural history
   collections. Founded in 1912, it is housed in the old Bute Medical
   School Building in St. Mary's Quad. Among its collections are the
   remains of several extinct species such as the dodo and Tasmanian tiger
   as well as fossilised fish from the nearby Dura Den, Fife, which when
   found in 1859 stimulated the debate on evolution.^[130]
   St Salvator's Chapel

Chapels[edit]

   The Wardlaw Wing of University Hall

   The University has two collegiate chapels. The chapel of St Salvator's
   (or "Sallies" as it is affectionately known) was founded in 1450 by
   Bishop James Kennedy, and today it is a centre of university
   life.^[131] St Salvator's has a full peal of six bells, and is
   therefore the only university chapel in Scotland suitable for change
   ringing.^[132] The Chapel of St Leonard's is located in the grounds of
   the nearby St Leonards School. It is the university's oldest building,
   some parts dating from 1144^[133] and is the smaller of the two
   chapels. St Salvator's and St Leonard's both have their own choirs,
   whose members are drawn from the student body.

Student halls[edit]

   St Andrews is characterised amongst Scottish universities as having a
   significant number of students who live in university-maintained
   accommodation. As of 2012, 52% of the student population live in
   university halls.^[134] The halls vary widely in age and character; the
   oldest, Deans Court dates from the 12th century, and the newest, David
   Russell Apartments, was built in 2004.^[135] They are built in styles
   from gothic revival to brutalist. All are now co-educational and
   non-smoking, and several are catered.^[136] The University guarantees
   every first year student a place of accommodation, and many students
   return to halls in their second, third and final years at St
   Andrews.^[137] From September 2015 onwards, students will have the
   option of living in alcohol-free flats in David Russell Apartments on
   the grounds of medical conditions that do not allow drinking or for
   religious reasons.^[138]
   St Salvator's Hall

   Halls of residence include:
     * Agnes Blackadder Hall
     * Albany Park
     * Andrew Melville Hall
     * David Russell Apartments
     * Fife Park Apartments
     * Gannochy House
     * Hamilton Hall
     * John Burnet Hall
     * McIntosh Hall
     * St Regulus Hall
     * St Salvator's Hall
     * University Hall
     * Angus and Stanley Smith Houses (Postgraduate only)
     * Deans Court (Postgraduate only)
     * St Gregory's (Postgraduate only)

Renewable energy projects[edit]

   Since 2013, the university's endowment has been invested under the
   United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment (UNPRI) initiative
   with a sustainable ethical policy enforced since 2007.^[139] The
   university has the target of being the UK's first carbon neutral
   university and has invested in creating two new macro-scale renewable
   energy sites.

   The Guardbridge Biomass Energy Centre will generate power using locally
   sourced wood-fuelled biomass, hot water will be transported to the
   university through underground pipes to heat and cool laboratories and
   student residences.^[140] The Â£25 million project is expected to save
   10,000 tonnes of carbon annually and the university aims to establish
   the site as a knowledge exchange hub which would provide "missing link"
   facilities to allow research and discoveries made in university labs to
   be translated to working prototypes. Work began onsite in 2014 and the
   centre is expected to be operational by December 2015.^[141]

   In October 2013, the university received permission to build six
   medium-sized turbines at Kenly Wind Farm, near Boarhills. The wind
   farms are expected to be operational by 2017 and will bring an
   estimated Â£22 million boost to the local and national economy with
   19,000 tonnes of carbon saved annually.^[142]

Student life[edit]

Students' association[edit]

   The University of St Andrews Students' Association is the organisation
   which represents the student body of the University of St
   Andrews.^[143] It was founded in 1885 and comprises the Students'
   Representative Council (SRC)^[144] and the Students' Services Council
   (SSC). The Students' Association has 9 subcommittees: The
   Entertainments "Ents" Committee, Societies Committee, Charities
   Campaign, Union Debating Society, STAR (St Andrews Radio), Mermaids
   Productions, LGBT, Design Team, SVS (Student Voluntary Service). Every
   matriculated student is automatically a member of each subcommittee.

   The Students' Association Building (informally known as the Union) is
   located on St Mary's Place, St Andrews. Union facilities include a
   Blackwells bookshop, several bars and the University's Student Support
   Services. In 2013 the Students' Association Building is scheduled to
   undergo a Â£12 million refurbishment.^[145] The Students' Association is
   affiliated to, and a founding member of, the Coalition of Higher
   Education Students in Scotland but unlike many other students' unions
   in the UK is not a member of the National Union of Students, having
   most recently rejected membership in a referendum in November 2012.

Societies[edit]

   Music Centre, Younger Hall

   St Andrews is home to over 140 student societies which cover a wide
   range of interests.^[146] In 2015, the university ranked top in
   Scotland and 3rd in the UK for Clubs &amp; Societies by university review
   platform, StudentCrowd.^[147]

   All matriculated students are members of the "Union Debating Society",
   a student debating society that holds weekly public debates in Lower
   Parliament Hall, often hosts notable speakers, and participates in
   competitive debating in both national and international competitions.
   Founded in 1794, it claims to be the oldest continuously-run student
   debating society in the world.^[148]

   There is a strong tradition of student media at St Andrews. The
   university's two newspapers are The Saint, a fortnightly publication
   and The Stand, an online publication founded in 2011.^[149] There is
   also the Foreign Affairs Review ran by the Foreign Affairs
   Society.^[150] There are also a number of smaller student publications
   including The Tribe, a student-run magazine^[151] and The Regulus, a
   student magazine focusing on politics and current affairs.^[152] In
   addition to this there are several student-led academic journals, most
   notably, Stereoscope Magazine which is focused on student photography
   and raising awareness of the university's historic photographic
   collection,^[153] Ha@sta, an annual journal for those interested in art
   history,^[154] Aporia, the journal of the Philosophy Society,^[155] and
   the Postgraduate Journal of Art History and Museum Studies.^[156] The
   University's radio station is STAR radio, an online station that
   broadcasts 24/7 during term time.^[157] The Sinner is an independent
   website and discussion forum set up by students of the
   university.^[158]
   Quadrangle of St Mary's College

   The university's Music Society comprises many student-run musical
   groups, including the university's flagship symphony orchestra, wind
   band, and chorus. One of the oldest choirs in the university is the St
   Andrews University Madrigal Group which performs a concert each term
   and has an annual summer tour. The A Cappella Society represents all
   four a cappella groups at St Andrews: The Other Guys, The Alleycats,
   The Accidentals and The Hummingbirds. From 2009â€“2011, all four of these
   groups participated in The Voice Festival UK(VF-UK) competition, and
   The Other Guys, The Accidentals and The Alleycats all reached the
   London final.^[159] In 2011, The Other Guys released a music video onto
   YouTube, entitled Royal Romance, a tribute to the wedding of Prince
   William and Catherine Middleton, which earned them significant
   recognition in both Scottish and international media.

   Student theatre at the University of St Andrews is funded by the
   Mermaids Performing Arts fund. There are regular dramatic and comedic
   performances staged at the Barron theatre.^[160] Blind Mirth is the
   university's improvisational theatre troupe, which performs weekly in
   the town, and annually takes a production to the Edinburgh Fringe
   Festival.^[161]

   The Kate Kennedy Club plays a significant role in the life of the
   university, maintaining university traditions such as the Kate Kennedy
   Procession, in which students parade through the town dressed as
   eminent figures from the university's history, and organising social
   events such as the Opening and May balls. Founded in 1926, the club is
   composed of around thirty matriculated students, who are selected by
   the club's members. The club has received criticism from the
   university's principal, Louise Richardson, and alumna the Duchess of
   Cambridge Kate Middleton over its previously male-only admission
   policy.^[162]^[163] In 2012, the club decided to allow female students
   to join.^[164]^[165]

   St Andrews is home to several other private clubs such as The
   Kensington Club, founded in 1739 by Alexander Laird Balgonie and is an
   all-male dining club that organises private events for
   members.^[166]^[167]

Sports clubs and the athletic union[edit]

   Main article: University of St Andrews Athletic Union
   Madras RFC Playing Fields St Andrews

   The University of St Andrews Athletic Union is the student
   representative body for sport. Established in 1901, it is affiliated to
   BUCS and encompasses around sixty sport clubs,^[168] who compete at
   both a recreational and high-performance level.^[169] A notable club is
   the University of St Andrews Rugby Football Club, which played a
   pivotal role in shaping the sport and has produced Scottish
   international players such as J. S. Thomson and Alfred
   Clunies-Ross.^[170] The university is currently undergoing through a
   Â£14 million five-phase development of the student sport centre which
   will include a new 400-seat eight-court sports hall, a new reception
   area and expanded gym facilities.^[171] The Scottish Varsity, also
   known as the "world's oldest varsity match", is played annually against
   the University of Edinburgh.^[172]

Traditions[edit]

   Entrance to St Mary's College

Sponsio Academica[edit]

   In order to become a student at the university^[173] a person must take
   an oath in Latin at the point of matriculation, called the Sponsio
   Academica, although this tradition now has been digitised and is agreed
   to as part of an online matriculation process.

     Nos ingenui adolescentes, nomina subscribentes, sancte pollicemur
     nos preceptoribus obsequium debitum exhibituros in omnibus rebus ad
     disciplinam et bonos mores pertinentibus, Senatus Academici
     autoritati obtemperaturos, et hujus Academiae Andreanae emolumentum
     et commodum, quantum in nobis sit, procuraturos, ad quemcunque vitae
     statum pervenerimus. Item agnoscimus si quis nostrum indecore
     turbulenterve se gesserit vel si parum diligentem in studiis suis se
     praebuerit neque admonitus se in melius correxerit eum licere
     Senatui Academico vel poena congruenti adficere vel etiam ex
     Universitate expellere.

   In English:

     We students who set down our names hereunder in all good faith make
     a solemn promise that we shall show due deference to our teachers in
     all matters relating to order and good conduct, that we shall be
     subject to the authority of the Senatus Academicus and shall,
     whatever be the position we attain hereafter, promote, so far as
     lies in our power, the profit and the interest in our University of
     St Andrews. Further, we recognise that, if any of us conducts
     ourselves in an unbecoming or disorderly manner or shows
     insufficient diligence in their studies and, though admonished, does
     not improve, it is within the power of the Senatus Academicus to
     inflict on such students a fitting penalty or even expel them from
     the University.

Gowns[edit]

   St Andrews students in undergraduate gowns
   See also: Undergraduate gowns in Scotland

   One of the most conspicuous traditions at St Andrews is the wearing of
   academic dress, particularly the distinctive red undergraduate gown of
   the United College. Undergraduates in Arts and Science subjects can be
   seen wearing these garments at the installation of a Rector or
   Chancellor, at chapel services, on 'Pier Walks', at formal hall
   dinners, at meetings of the Union Debating Society, giving tours to
   prospective students and visitors as well as on St Andrews day.
   Divinity students wear a black undergraduate gown with a purple saltire
   cross on the left facing. Postgraduates wear the graduate gown or, as
   members of St Leonard College, may wear a black gown trimmed with
   burgundy, introduced for graduate students whose original university is
   without academic dress. (See Academic dress of the University of St
   Andrews.) St Mary's College Post Graduates, however, wear their
   graduate gown with a purple saltire cross on the left facing.

Bejant[edit]

   Bejant is a term used to refer to first year male students; females
   being described as Bejantines. Second-year students are known as a
   Semis, a student in their third year may be referred to as a Tertian,
   and in their final year as a Magistrand. These terms are thought^[by
   whom?] to be unique to St Andrews. When wearing their traditional red
   gowns, students in each year may be identified according to the way
   they wear their gowns. In the first year, the gown is worn on the
   shoulders, in the second year it is worn slightly off the shoulders. In
   the third year arts students wear their gowns off their left shoulders,
   and science students off their right shoulders. Finally, fourth years
   wear their gowns right down to their elbows, ready to shed their
   scarlet gowns for the black graduation gown. The gown is never to be
   joined at the top as this is considered bad luck.

Academic parents[edit]

   The students of the University enjoy an unusual family tradition
   designed to make new students feel at home and build relationships
   within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires
   academic parents who are at least in their third year as students.
   These older students act as informal mentors in academic and social
   matters and it is not uncommon for such academic family ties to stretch
   well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask a man
   to be his Senior Man but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to
   be his Senior Woman. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her
   Senior Man but there is no overt rule regarding how she acquires a
   Senior Woman. The establishment of these relationships begins at the
   very start of the first semester â€“ with the aim of being in place ahead
   of Raisin Weekend.^[174]

Raisin Weekend[edit]

   St Salvator's Quadrangle during the Raisin Weekend foam fight

   Raisin Weekend celebrates the relationship between the
   Bejants/Bejantines (First-Year students) and their respective Academic
   Parents who, in St. Andrews' tradition, guide and mentor them in their
   time at the University. It is traditionally said that students went up
   to study with a sack of oatmeal and a barrel of salt-herring as staple
   foods to last them a term and that therefore anything more exotic was
   seen as a luxury. In return for the guidance from academic parents a
   further tradition sprang up of rewarding these "parents" with a pound
   of raisins. Since the 19th century the giving of raisins was steadily
   transformed into the giving of a more modern alternative â€“ such as a
   bottle of wine. In return for the raisins or equivalent present the
   parents give their "children" a formal receipt â€“ the Raisin Receipt â€“
   composed in Latin. Over time this receipt progressively became more
   elaborate and often humorous. The receipt can be written on anything
   and is to be carried everywhere by the Bejant/Bejantine on the morning
   of Raisin Monday until midday.^[175]

   Raisin Weekend is held annually over the last weekend of November.
   Affairs often begin with a tea party (or similar) thrown by the
   mother(s) and then a pub-crawl or house party led by the father(s). It
   is fairly common for several academic families to combine in the latter
   stages of the revels.^[176] At midday all the First-Years gather in
   Quad of St Salvator's College to compare their receipts and also to be
   open to challenge from older students who may look for errors in the
   Latin of the receipt (an almost inevitable occurrence). Upon detection
   of such error(s) the bearer may be required to sing the Gaudie. In
   recent years the gathering has culminated in a shaving foam
   fight.^[177] Raisin Weekend has also become synonymous with binge
   drinking and a certain amount of humiliation of "academic children",
   commonly involving embarrassing costumes or drinking games. The
   University Students' Association provides a special First Aid hotline
   for Raisin Weekend.^[178]

Cobblestones[edit]

   Situated around the town of St Andrews are cobblestone markings
   denoting where Protestant martyrs were burnt at the stake. To students,
   the most notable of these is the cobblestone initials "PH" located
   outside the main gate of St Salvator's College. These cobblestones
   denote where Patrick Hamilton was martyred in 1528.^[179] According to
   student tradition, stepping on the "PH" will cause a student to become
   cursed, with the effect that the offender will fail his or her degree
   and so students are known to jump over the cobblestones when passing.
   The 'curse' is said to be lifted by running backwards around St.
   Salvator's College 8 times while naked, or by participating in the May
   Dip.^[180]
   St Andrews May Dip 2013

May Dip[edit]

   The May Dip is a student tradition held annually at dawn on May Day.
   Students usually stay awake until dawn, at which time they collectively
   run into the North Sea to the sound of madrigals sung by the University
   Madrigal Group.^[181] Students purportedly do so to cleanse themselves
   of any academic sins (which they may have acquired by stepping on the
   PH cobblestone) before they sit exams in May.^[182] In 2011, the event
   was 'officially' moved by the Students' Association to East Sands in
   response to concerns for health and safety in its former location on
   Castle Sands.
