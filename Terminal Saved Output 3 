>    In the second half of the 19th century, pressure was building upon
>    universities to open up higher education to women.^[27] In 1876, the
>    University Senate decided to allow women to receive an education at St
>    Andrews at a level roughly equal to the Master of Arts degree that men
>    were able to take at the time. The scheme came to be known as the
>    'L.L.A. examination' (Lady Literate in Arts). It required women to pass
>    five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level and
>    entitled them to hold a degree from the university.^[28] In 1889 the
>    Universities (Scotland) Act^[29] made it possible to formally admit
>    women to St Andrews and to receive an education equal to that of male
>    students. Agnes Forbes Blackadder became the first woman to graduate

>    Main article: Governance of the University of St Andrews
> 
>    As with the other ancient universities of Scotland, the governance of
>    the university is determined by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.
>    This Act created three bodies: the General Council, University Court
>    and Academic Senate (Senatus Academicus).
> 
> General Council[edit]
> 
>    Main article: General Council of St Andrews University
> 
>    The General Council is a standing advisory body of all the graduates,
>    academics and former academics of the university. It meets twice a year
>    and appoints a business committee to manage business between these
>    meetings. Its most important functions are to appoint two assessors to
>    the University Court and elect the university's chancellor.
> 
> University Court[edit]
> 
>    School of English
> 
>    The University Court is the body responsible for administrative and
>    financial matters, and is in effect the governing body of the
>    university. It is chaired by the rector, who is elected by the
>    matriculated students of the University. Members are appointed by the
>    General Council, Academic Senate and Fife Council. The President of the
>    Students' Association and Director of Representation are ex officio
>    members of the Court. Several lay members are also co-opted and must
>    include a fixed number of alumni of the University.
> 
> Senatus Academicus[edit]
> 
>    The Academic Senate (Latin Senatus Academicus) is the supreme academic
>    body for the university. Its members include all the professors of the
>    university, certain senior readers, a number of senior lecturers and
>    lecturers and three elected student senate representatives â€“ one from
>    the arts and divinity faculty, one from the science and medicine
>    faculty and one postgraduate student. It is responsible for authorising
>    degree programmes and issuing all degrees to graduates, and for
>    managing student discipline. The President of the Senate is the
>    University Principal.
> 
> Office of the Principal[edit]
> 
>    The Principal is the chief executive of the university and is assisted
>    in that role by several key officers, including the Deputy Principal,
>    Master of the United College and Quaestor. The principal has
>    responsibility for the overall running of the university and presides
>    over the University Senate.^[53]

> Rector[edit]

>    Main article: Rector of the University of St Andrews
> 
>    In Scotland, the position of rector exists at the four ancient
>    universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) â€“ as well as
>    the University of Dundee. The post was made an integral part of these
>    universities by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. The Rector of the
>    University of St Andrews chairs meetings of the University Court, the
>    governing body of the university; and is elected by the matriculated
>    student body to ensure that their needs are adequately considered by
>    the university's leadership. Through St Andrews' history a number of
>    notable people have been elected to the post, including the actor John
>    Cleese, industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, author and
>    poet Rudyard Kipling and the British Prime Minister Archibald Primrose,
>    5th Earl of Rosebery.^[54]
> 
> Colleges[edit]
> 
>    The university encompasses three colleges, although their purpose is
>    mainly ceremonial as students are housed in separate residential halls
>    or private accommodations. United College has responsibility for all
>    students in the faculties of arts, sciences and medicine, and is based
>    around St Salvator's Quadrangle;^[55] St Mary's College has
>    responsibility for all students studying in the Faculty of Divinity,
>    and has its own dedicated site in St Mary's Quadrangle;^[56] and St
>    Leonard's College, in its current incarnation, has responsibility for
>    all postgraduate students.^[57]
> 
> Faculties and schools[edit]
> 
>    The four academic faculties collectively encompass 18 schools. A dean
>    is appointed by the Master of the United College to oversee the
>    day-to-day running of each faculty. Students apply to become members of
>    a particular faculty, as opposed to the school within which teaching is
>    based. The faculties and their affiliated schools are:
>      * Faculty of Arts: art history, classics, economics, English, film
>        studies, history, international relations, management, modern
>        languages, philosophy.^[58]
>      * Faculty of Divinity: divinity.^[59]
>      * Faculty of Medicine: medicine.^[60]
>      * Faculty of Science: biology, chemistry, computer science, geography
>        and geosciences, mathematics, physics and astronomy, psychology and
>        neuroscience.^[61]
> 
>    Certain subjects are offered both within the Faculties of Arts and
>    Sciences, the six subjects are: economics, geography, management,
>    mathematics, psychology and sustainable development. The content of the

>    The academic year at St Andrews is divided into two semesters,
>    Martinmas and Candlemas, named after two of the four Scottish Term and
>    Quarter Days. Martinmas, on 11 November, was originally the feast of
>    Saint Martin of Tours, a 4th-century bishop and hermit. Candlemas
>    originally fell on 2 February, the day of the feast of the
>    Purification, or the Presentation of Christ. Martinmas semester runs
>    from early September until mid-December, with examinations taking place
>    just before the Christmas break. There follows an inter-semester period
>    when Martinmas semester business is concluded and preparations are made
>    for the new Candlemas semester, which starts in January and concludes
>    with examinations at the end of May. Graduation is celebrated at the

>    university halls.^[134] The halls vary widely in age and character; the
>    oldest, Deans Court dates from the 12th century, and the newest, David
>    Russell Apartments, was built in 2004.^[135] They are built in styles
>    from gothic revival to brutalist. All are now co-educational and
>    non-smoking, and several are catered.^[136] The University guarantees
>    every first year student a place of accommodation, and many students
>    return to halls in their second, third and final years at St
>    Andrews.^[137] From September 2015 onwards, students will have the
>    option of living in alcohol-free flats in David Russell Apartments on
>    the grounds of medical conditions that do not allow drinking or for
>    religious reasons.^[138]

> 
>    The Guardbridge Biomass Energy Centre will generate power using locally
>    sourced wood-fuelled biomass, hot water will be transported to the
>    university through underground pipes to heat and cool laboratories and
>    student residences.^[140] The Â£25 million project is expected to save

>    facilities to allow research and discoveries made in university labs to
>    be translated to working prototypes. Work began onsite in 2014 and the
>    centre is expected to be operational by December 2015.^[141]

>    In October 2013, the university received permission to build six
